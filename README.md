### Datasets
Please use the preprocessing steps of [Hierarchical Image Manipulation](https://github.com/xcyan/neurips18_hierchical_image_manipulation) to prepare the datasets.

Then, use a symbolic link (ln -s) or put them in the datasets folder. 

### Pretrained Models

You can find the pretrained models for the tasks of Image Editing and Layout to Image Generation [here](https://owncloud.csem.ch/owncloud/index.php/s/YD0JyynKNEbgde5)! 

### Training/Testing Scripts
Use the files in the scripts folder to train/test the model.
